# About

This is the source for Ian Jeffries' [personal website](http://housejeffries.com/).

The final output is generated with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

# Content

Articles and other meaty content are [versioned separately](https://github.com/seagreen/housejeffries-content).

I keep that directory symlinked to `_content` within this directory.

# Run

`cabal run rebuild`

(`cabal run build` works too, but doesn't propogate file deletions.)
